# ChatBot

## Project Overview
This ChatBot project was developed as a learning purpose focused on exploring machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning within the realm of natural language processing.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is educational. Due to limited training data, the ChatBot's current accuracy is modest, making it more of an educational tool than a robust question-answering system.

## Folder Structure and Files

### FirstVersion Folder
Initially, an attempt was made to create a ChatBot using Flask. However, this approach is not exactly what desired but it is an effort worth saving. 

### Chatbot Virtual Environment
The `Chatbot` directory serves as the virtual environment specifically created for running this project.

### Source Folder
Contains intent files used in the project. One before running the no_replicate file, the other is after. 

### no_replicate File
A utility file is used to ensure there are no duplicate patterns in the intent files. This file can be modified to suit different situations and has broad applications. 

### one_file
This file includes scripts for loading data, preprocessing, building the model, saving and testing it.

## Note
This is just a little fun thing for me to do and work on to familiarize myself with the skills I have enjoyed doing this and the model feedback is funny because of the lack of training data which can be fixed easily using API generating files needed. You can do so if you so desire. 

Lastly, 
Have fun, and thank you!
