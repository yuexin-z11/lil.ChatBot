ChatBot
This ChatBot was built for the purpose of learning machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning. To train the ChatBot properly, it requires large testing data files. 
Therefore, its accuracy is rather low, and it should be seen more as a fun project rather than a tool for answering questions. Nonetheless, working on this project has demonstrated my skills in understanding and building neural networks.

Have fun, and thank you!
